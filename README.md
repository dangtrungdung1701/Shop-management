# USUM SOFTWARE REACTJS TEMPLATE

# [React](https://reactjs.org/) &middot;

## **Quick Start**

In this Docs, I'll guide you step-by-step, to help you ready for joining this
project.

### **Intro Technologies & Weapons**

Here is some cool technology we have been using for this project.

#### **Frameworks & Libraries**

- First of all, this project use **ReactJS**.
- Secondary, We use **Tailwind**. Please read a really nice blog talk about this
  in here:
  [How to Style Your React Apps with Less Code Using Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Twin Macro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-your-react-apps-with-less-code-using-tailwind-css-and-styled-components/).

- **Formik**. This will help us control this Form in HTML. Everyone know that
  Form is really hard. so this will help us not only value controller but also
  validation of inputs. [Formik docs](https://formik.org/docs/overview)
- **HeadlessUI**. `Dropdown`, `Listbox`, `Disclosure`, `Dialog`, `Popover`,
  `Radio Group`,... This is a cool tool which is completely unstyled, fully
  accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS.
  [Check its docs](https://headlessui.dev/)

#### **Code Formatter**

- **Prettier** - keep your code cleanly.

#### **VSCode extension**

To make sure you will be given fully support for coding. Please use VSCode.

- **Code spell check**. This tool will help you won't be taken silly spell
  mistakes
- **Prettier**. This is clean-code-keeper which will make sure your code isn't
  like s\*\*t. And make sure you turn on "Auto format when save". Check this
  [Blog](https://www.codereadability.com/automated-code-formatting-with-prettier/)
- **Headwind**. A tool will automatically sort your className of tailwind or
  twin.

#### **VSCode snippets**

This is powerful tool, which is natively written by us. Simply, it will help you
write code faster.

- Firstly, please check file `.vscode/nextjs.code-snippets`.
- Then text some prefix.
- Ready for code faster
